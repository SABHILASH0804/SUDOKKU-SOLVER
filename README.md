# SUDOKKU-SOLVER

# Java Sudoku Solver

Description: The Java Sudoku Solver is a program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently using recursion, arrays, and bit manipulation. The SudokuSolver class provides functionality to solve Sudoku grids by employing recursive techniques and backtracking. It utilizes a 2D array to represent the Sudoku grid, where empty cells are denoted by '0'. The solver ensures adherence to Sudoku rules by implementing the isSafe method to check for safe number placements. Bit manipulation techniques are employed to efficiently check for duplicates in rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids. Users can instantiate the SudokuSolver class to solve Sudoku puzzles and display the solved grid. This project serves as a valuable resource for understanding recursive algorithms and bit manipulation in Java programming
